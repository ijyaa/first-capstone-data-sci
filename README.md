This project is a data analysis of credit cards default rates based on this dataset https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/default+of+credit+card+clients. The dataset looks at 30,000 credit card customers in Taiwan. The main distinction this dataset aims to make is between credible vs. non-credible clients. There are various demographic factors for clients such as age, gender (binary in this particular dataset), education (various levels), limit balances, relationship status (various statuses). 

My goal here was to answer these three main questions: 

- Is there a correlation between social factors age / gender/ education / relationship status and default rates? Is one group more likely to default than others?
- Does limit balance play a factor in default rates? Are customers with a lower balance more likely to default than customers with higher balances? Also, who gets more limit balances by age groups?
- Can bill amount predict default rates? Does a high bill amount lead to higher default rates?
